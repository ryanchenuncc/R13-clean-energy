        <h3>Chart Explanation</h3>
        <p>
          This horizontal bar chart illustrates the annual energy production capacity measured in gigawatt-hours (GWh)
          for Norwegian hydropower facilities. The Sogn og Fjordane Energi (SFE) total portfolio leads significantly
          at 2,400 GWh, representing the cumulative output of multiple facilities across their operations and
          sufficient to power approximately 130,000 Norwegian households. The Øksenelvane plant contributes 171 GWh
          annually after its modernization, while the upgraded Svean facility generates 132 GWh per year, demonstrating
          how strategic infrastructure improvements can substantially increase renewable energy output from existing
          hydropower sites.
